Matlab Projects
I created this Matlab app for my programming fundamentals course. 

The elevator will begin at the basement and will then move once the user defines what level they are at. Once inside the elevator, the user can choose which floor they would like to go to. Once the selection is made, the elevator door will close, the elevator will go to the specified floor (it's only three floors), and then the door will open again. 

Any comments on how to improve this would be appreciated.
